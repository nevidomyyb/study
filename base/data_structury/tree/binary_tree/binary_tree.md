### Complete

A complete binary tree has all levels full of nodes, except the last leveL, where it can be full or filled from left to right. A complete tree it is also balanced.

### Full

A full binary tree has all nodes with 0 or 2 child nodes.

### Perfect

A perfect binary tree has all leaf nodes on the same leve, which it means that all leves are full of nodes and all intern nodes has 2 child nodes. The properties of a perfect binary tree means it is also full, balanced and complete.444
