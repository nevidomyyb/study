1. Data Manipulation
Efficiently handling, cleaning, and transforming datasets.

Python (pandas):
DataFrames: Loading, selecting, filtering, and mutating columns.
GroupBy and Aggregations: Summarizing and analyzing groups within datasets.
Handling Missing Data: Fill, drop, or impute missing values.
R (dplyr/tidyr):
Pipes (%>%): Streamlining workflows.
Functions: filter(), select(), mutate(), summarize().
Tidying Data: gather(), spread() for reshaping data.
2. Data Visualization
Creating insightful visualizations to explore patterns and insights.

Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly):
Basic Charts: Line plots, bar charts, scatter plots.
Statistical Visualizations: Boxplots, histograms, heatmaps.
Interactive Plots: Using Plotly for dashboards and exploratory analysis.
R (ggplot2):
Grammar of Graphics: Aesthetic mappings, geoms, and layers.
Facets: Creating multi-panel plots to compare groups.
Customization: Themes, labels, and scales for advanced visualizations.
3. Statistical Analysis
Performing hypothesis testing and drawing insights from data.

Python (SciPy/statsmodels):
Hypothesis Testing: t-tests, chi-square tests, ANOVA.
Regression Models: Linear and logistic regression.
Confidence Intervals: Calculating and interpreting results.
R (stats/base):
Basic Statistics: mean(), sd(), summary().
Regression: lm() for linear models, glm() for logistic models.
Hypothesis Testing: Functions like t.test(), chisq.test().
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Extracting insights and identifying patterns in datasets.

Python (pandas/NumPy/Seaborn):
Summary Statistics: describe(), correlation matrices.
Distribution Analysis: Histograms, density plots, boxplots.
Pairwise Relationships: Scatterplot matrices and heatmaps.
R (tidyverse/ggplot2):
Dataset Summarization: summary(), cor().
Exploring Relationships: ggpairs() from GGally.
Handling Outliers: Detecting and treating anomalies in data.
5. Advanced Topics in Data Analysis
Going beyond the basics for in-depth analysis.

Python:
Time Series Analysis: Using libraries like statsmodels and prophet.
Text Analysis: Tokenization, TF-IDF, and sentiment analysis with nltk or spaCy.
Data Pipelines: Automating workflows with libraries like dask or prefect.
R:
Time Series: Using forecast and xts packages for ARIMA and exponential smoothing.
Text Mining: tm and tidytext for textual analysis and sentiment scoring.
Shiny Dashboards: Building interactive data applications in R.
