Fundamentals:

Types of ML: supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning.
Model evaluation: metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curve.
Bias-variance tradeoff: overfitting and underfitting.
Regularization techniques: L1 (Lasso), L2 (Ridge), and ElasticNet.
Feature engineering: feature scaling, encoding, and selection techniques.
