Architectures:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): image recognition, transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG, EfficientNet).
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): time-series analysis, LSTMs, GRUs.
Transformers: attention mechanisms, BERT, GPT, Vision Transformers (ViT).
Generative models: GANs (e.g., StyleGAN, CycleGAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).
Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL): Q-learning, PPO, DDPG, AlphaZero.
